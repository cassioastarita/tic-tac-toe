# Tic Tac Toe Mario Bros edition
Tic Tac Toe Edition Mario Bros is an exciting game where there will be a board of three by three cells and two symbols ("X" and "O"), one for each player. Then they will mark the sign inside a box on the board. The one who has his symbol marked in a sequence of three can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal, will be the winner. If both players fail to get their symbols in a row of three, the game will end in a tie or a tie. This is the logic of the Tic Tac Toe game.

## Aprouch problemas
Difficult to measure just one difficulty in building this game that was made in less than 5 days with a knowledge of 3 weeks of course. But surely Java Script as a whole was the biggest challenge.


## Cool tech used
I focused on the classic Mario Bros style, using the same family font background and music.
